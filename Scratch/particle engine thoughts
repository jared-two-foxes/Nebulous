# Things to Consider
  [*] Immplement some form of motion paths and should this come from the emitter or the particle group?
  [*] Allow for particle rotation?
  [*] Immplement some exposed way to define variance for the defined values
      [*] Maybe have 2 ways to specify the value ie "x":100 OR "x":{"value":100,"variance":20} for a
          simple positive negative variance (100 +/- 20)

# Particle group information.
  [*] We support different textures.
      [*] currently uses straight images, could refactor to use sprite atlasing?
  [*] We support different life times of the particles (with no variance)
  [*] We support a scale factor to apply to the particle over time.
  [*] Sample as follows;

      {
        "texture":"bubble_01.png",
        "life":20.0,
        "scale_factor":0.1
      }


# Particle Emitter information
  [*] We allow the emitter to have a changable tank size.
  [*] We expose the initial force of the particles as they are emitted
  [*] Sample as follows;

      {
        "tank":[
          {
            "count":400,
            "flow":0.3,
            "group":"path_to_the_group_descriptor_file"
          }
        ],
        "force":{ 
          "x":{"min":-30.0,"max":30.0},
          "y":{"min":20.0,"max":60.0},
          "z":{"min":0,"max":0}
        }
      }

  [*] usage would be something like;

      ParticleEmitter* emitter = m_pParticleSystem->CreateEmitter( jsonfilename );
      assert( emitter );
      if( emitter )
      {
        emitter->SetPosition( Vector4(x,y,z) );
        emitter->Start(); 
      }
